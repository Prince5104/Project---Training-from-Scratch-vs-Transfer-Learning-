# Project---Training-from-Scratch-vs-Transfer-Learning-
Welcome to the project on Training from Scratch vs Transfer Learning. In this exercise, we will understand how to train a neural network from scratch to classify data using TensorFlow 2. We would also learn how to use the weights of an already trained model to achieve classification to another set of data.
